# ðŸŽ¬ IMDb Data Exploration Project

This project explores real-world movie data from IMDb using Python, SQLite, and Jupyter Notebooks.

## âœ… Goals
- Practice loading TSV files into SQLite
- Run SQL queries on a multi-table schema
- Visualize trends in movie ratings and genres
- Uses sqlite's auto indexing for queries, could use parallelization platforms to speed up queries

## ðŸ“Ž Files
- `load_data.py` â€“ TSV to SQLite loader
- `notebooks/imdb_analysis.ipynb` â€“ Analysis and visualizations
- `queries/` â€“ SQL-only versions of key queries

To download the full dataset:

1. Visit [IMDb Datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
2. Download the files (e.g., `title.basics.tsv.gz`, `title.akas.tsv.gz`)
3. Place them in the `data/` directory
4. Run `scripts/load_data.py` to load into SQLite
